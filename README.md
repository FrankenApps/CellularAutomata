# Cellular Automata

This is a little web project with Javascript and D3.js. When ready it will be possible to create 1D cellular automata with it.

## Todo

1. Implement a proper ProgressBar (which works in chrome, too), since updating can take pretty long..
2. Improve mobile UI
  1. Make top bar vertical scrollable
  2. Remove Bootstrap Slider in mobile view
  3. Increase Button and Switch size
