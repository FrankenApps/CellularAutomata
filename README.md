# Cellular Automata

This is a little web project with Javascript and D3.js. When ready it will be possible to create 1D cellular automata with it.

## Todo

1. Improve the rule selector for mobile devices
2. Implement a faster and especially correct working algorithm

## Warning
I have to admit that because of the way the algorithm is currently implemented, it may in some cases produce slightly incorrect results at the left and right margins, especially the left one.
