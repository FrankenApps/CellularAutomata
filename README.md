# Pendulum Simulation

This is a little web project with Javascript and D3.js. It simulations two pendulums one swinging horizontally and the other one swings vertical.

## Todo

Simulation is inconsistent and I would like to use a numerical differential equations solver in the future...
Apart from that I am going to fix an issue with setting the environment variables first.
